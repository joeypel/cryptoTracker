        "description": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It’s a permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrency that requires no trusted third parties and no central bank. It was created in 2017 after the Bitcoin community split in two (or hard-forked) over scalability issues. The plan for a Bitcoin alternative was pushed through by Bitcoin activists, investors, entrepreneurs, developers, and largely China-based miners. It was considered to be one of the most successful hard-forks of the original Bitcoin. At the time of the fork, anyone owning Bitcoin was also given the same number of Bitcoin Cash units. \n\n Bitcoin Cash increases the size of blocks, allowing for more transactions to be processed. Because the blocks are larger and contain more information, more computational power is needed to process (or mine) them. \n\n The larger block sizes remove the need for Segregated Witness (SegWit), a code adjustment used by Bitcoin to free up block space by removing certain parts of the transaction. One issue the community had with SegWit was that it forced transactions to happen off-chain, breaking the economic incentives to make Bitcoin work. By using larger blocks and speeding up transaction process time it is hoped that Bitcoin Cash will remain on-chain and still be able to compete with the number of transactions established by financial platforms like Visa or Paypal. \n\n The Bitcoin Cash protocol ensures there will never be more than 21 million coins in existence. The platform states that no transaction is too big or too small and that their network is on 24-hours a day, 365 days a year. \n\n By the end of 2018, Bitcoin Cash boasted sub-cent transaction fees, it was accepted at around 670 physical locations around the world, which (it claimed) made it the most secure and widely used digital currency on the planet.",

        "description": "Bitcoin (₿) (BTC) is a decentralized virtual digital currency that can be sent between users through the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. It was the first example of a cryptocurrency, a growing asset class that shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, but has verification based on cryptography. \n\n The term ‘Bitcoin’ can refer to the token (a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital value) or it can refer to the technology (a distributed network that maintains the ledger of balances of the Bitcoin token). \n\n The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper, entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ outlined an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by everyone in the network. \n\n Bitcoin was first released as version 0.1 in January 2009, by Satoshi and was published on SourceForge, an online collaboration platform for developers. Anyone could download the source code and run it to join the network. Satoshi continued to write the Bitcoin code until 2010 and then handed it over to the open source community. The smallest unit of a Bitcoin is called a Satoshi after its founder(s) and represents one-hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. The first Bitcoin was created when Satoshi mined the first block of the chain, known as the genesis block. \n\n There is said to be a limit of ₿21 million which can be mined. The supply is tightly controlled by an underlying algorithm. So, like gold, there is a limited and finite supply. Unlike the currencies issued by banks and governments, Bitcoin is not vulnerable to losing its value if the centralized issuing authority breaks down. The decentralized system can continue to operate as long as there are members in the network. \n\n The managing of transactions and the issuing of Bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source, its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. It is maintained by a group of volunteer coders and run by an open network of dedicated computers spread around the world. \n\n Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining, which comprises adding transaction records (or blocks of code) to Bitcoin's public ledger (or chain) of past transactions and keeping them in the queue. Blocks are chopped off as each transaction is finalized, codes deciphered, and Bitcoins passed or exchanged. Miners use special software to solve the math problems that keep the Bitcoin process secure and are issued a certain number of Bitcoins in return. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine.",

        "description": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a second generation blockchain, a network, a community, and a cryptocurrency. In addition to allowing people to send amounts of value to each other, ETC allows for complex contracts that operate autonomously and cannot be modified or censored. \n\n Both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum (ETH) have a value token called ‘Ether’, which can be transferred between participants, stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed on the Ethereum Platform. \n\n The Ethereum concept was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer in late 2013. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014, with the Ethereum system going live on 30 July 2015. \n\n Two years after Ethereum’s launch there was a hack which caused a split in the community, often described as a ‘battle of ethics and ideology’. The victims were investors in a fund called the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which was launched by the Ethereum community as a decentralized investment fund for smart contract projects. \n\n Instead of a few venture capitalist partners making decisions on which projects to invest in, DAO holders were promised a voting input in investments. The project was so popular that the ICO attracted over $150 million in funding. \n\n In June, 3.6 million Ether (worth approximately $50 million USD) was taken from accounts in the DAO and moved to another account without the owners' consent, exploiting one of several vulnerabilities that had already been flagged by community members. A loophole in the code allowed someone to repeat a refund request multiple times for the same DAO tokens before the transaction could be registered on the system. The recursive function was able to run until a third of DAO’s funds were siphoned off. \n\n Ironically the stolen currency can never be spent because the code in the blockchain would allow them to be traced. Following the hack, there was a majority decision that Ethereum needed to fork and create something new from scratch. \n\n The new protocol retained the original name Ethereum (ETH) because of the amount of community support for the fork. It functions on a brand new blockchain, and the vast majority of miners, users, and protocol from the previous version of Ethereum use this new version. In this sense, Ethereum functions more like a software company. ETH’s primary value is in its use case scenarios and community support. The Ethereum Alliance, for example, consists of billion-dollar firms such as Accenture, JP Morgan, Microsoft, and UBS. The Ethereum chain that forked (ETH) was able to retrieve the $50 million that was hacked and return it to investors. \n\n Ethereum Classic (ETC) has a new name but is the original version of the Ethereum protocol using the original blockchain. Only 10% of the community was in favor of keeping it, but it is said to still retain value because of the speculative nature of the crypto market.",

        "description": "Ether (ETH) (Ξ) is a cryptocurrency whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum network. Unlike Bitcoin, which aims to disrupt the banking system with its own digital currency, the Ethereum platform’s goal is to use blockchain to replace internet third parties, particularly those that store data, transfer mortgages, and keep track of complex financial instruments. \n\n Ethereum is made up of nodes run by volunteers across the world, the nodes form what has been described as a ‘world computer’, a decentralized mining network which is not governed by any third parties like, for example, servers and clouds are. \n\n The volunteers, or miners, use their own computational power (gas) to run the network. This involves passing blocks of code between each other and solving the mathematical problems that keep the code secure in exchange for Ether. The currency is listed on exchanges, and can only be used on the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for gas and transaction fees. \n\n Ethereum is open-source, public, and highly programmable. Anyone can use or modify its software to build upon the computing platform and operating system. The platform gives developers the opportunity to build their own digital assets on the Ethereum infrastructure without having to create their own blockchain. This has given rise to hundreds of Ethereum blockchain based tokens (such as Binance Coin, Golem, and Basic Attention Coin). In 2017, at the height of crypto-mania Ethereum was leading blockchain platform for Initial Coin Offering  (ICO) projects, with over 50% market share. \n\n The Ethereum concept was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer in late 2013. He believed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. When he was unable to gain agreement, he devised a new platform with a more general scripting language. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014, with the Ethereum system going live on 30 July 2015.",

        "description": "Litecoin (LTC) (Ł) is a is a рееr-tо-рееr сrурtосurrеnсу аnd open ѕоurсе software project. It is very similar to Bitcoin but transactions are much faster. Litecoin users are also able to transfer with lower fees than they would if they made a traditional bank transfer. \n\n The crеаtіоn аnd transfer оf Litecoin іѕ bаѕеd on a ореn-source сrурtоgrарhіс рrоtосоl which іѕ nоt mаnаgеd bу аnу сеntrаl authority. Litecoin enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. \n\n The coin is designed for everyday use, pumping out four times as many coins as Bitcoin, in an effort to keep the digital currency from becoming scarce and too expensive. Transactions are also said to be four times faster. There is a limit of 84 million Litecoins. \n\n Litecoin was released on October 7, 2011, via an open-source client on GitHub, under MIT/X11 lісеnѕеѕ which are permissive forms of open software licenses with limited restrictions on reuse. The Litecoin Network went live on October 13, 2011, and is described as a fork of the Bitcoin Core client. In addition to trading and purchasing Litecoin, it is possible to mine it, which essentially means providing the network with computational power in exchange for the digital currency. As of 2018, miners were awarded 25 new Litecoins per block, an amount which will get halved roughly every 4 years (every 840,000 blocks). \n\n In May 2017, Litecoin became the first of the top 5 (by market cap) cryptocurrencies to adopt Segregated Witness (known as SegWit), which is a soft fork allowing optimal data transmission while bypassing certain protocol restrictions. This (amongst other things) not only speeds up transactions but allows for larger block sizes. \n\n The currency was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee and Engineering Director at Coinbase. Litecoin is his second attempt at a cryptocurrency, having launched one called Fairbrix which didn’t get off the ground due to technical problems. In 2017 Charlie sold or donated all of his Litecoins except for a few he kept as collectibles. He took the decision not to hold a significant amount of the tokens to avoid a conflict of interest. \n\n The Litecoin blockchain is the largest global scrypt based network, operating with 100% uptime since 2011 securing and transacting billions of dollars of value. Scrypt is an algorithm specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory. \n\n Litecoin was created to make mining as accessible and democratized as possible, rather than being monopolized by companies with huge mining capabilities. Since the time between mining blocks is small, more miners have the opportunity to mine blocks and earn mining rewards. At the beginning of 2018, 14,400 Litecoins were being mined a day, the maximum number possible.",

        "description": "Tether (₮) (USD₮) is a cryptocurrency with digital tokens designed to replicate the value of the United States Dollar. The theory is that this provides protection from the volatility of cryptocurrencies, so 1 USD₮ will always be worth $1. To achieve this Tether claims to have each token backed 100% by actual assets in the platform’s reserve account. \n\n The origins of Tether came from a whitepaper published online in January 2012, in which software developer J.R. Willett described the possibility of building new currencies on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Credited with ‘inventing the ICO’ to fund the project, Willett went on to implement his idea in the form of the ‘Mastercoin’. The Mastercoin protocol became the technological foundation of the Tether platform. Tethers exist on blockchains using the Omni Protocol, and as ERC20 tokens. \n\n Two original members of the Mastercoin Foundation, Brock Pierce and Craig Sellars, became co-founders of Tether. Former child actor, Brock was a minor partner in a digital entertainment network that raised $88 million in venture capital in the 1990s. In 2013, he joined brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens in founding the venture capital firm Blockchain Capital (BCC) which was reported to have raised $85 million in two venture funds by October 2017. \n\n Co-founder Craig Sellars started his career as a UX developer, worked in various engineering positions before presiding over a number of wireless operations. His first foray into the blockchain space was at Tether, later becoming CTO of exchange Bitfinnex for a year and a half. Since then he has held a variety of roles as co-founder, technologist, facilitator, and advisor for several blockchain projects and companies including vAtomic, Unsung, Fuzo, Factom, Synereo, Tau Chain and the MaidSafe Foundation. He is the founder of the Omni Foundation which developed the protocol used by Tether. \n\n Reeve Collins, the third co-founder, launched several ventures before Tether, including Traffic Marketplace, one of the first online ad networks to be acquired by Vivendi Universal, RedLever, a branded entertainment studio, acquired by Adconion Media Group, and Pala Interactive, where he secured $70 million to create a legal, real-money gambling site in the US. \n\n Tether was incorporated in Hong Kong with offices in Switzerland. In January 2015, the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex enabled Tether trading on its platform. Bitfinex officials Philip Potter and Giancarlo Devasini were responsible for setting up Tether Holdings Limited in the British Virgin Islands in 2014. A spokesperson for Bitfinex and Tether stated that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde was also the CEO of both firms at the time.",

        "description": "XRP is the native digital asset of the Ripple platform. Ripple aims to connect banks and payment providers to provide a frictionless experience for sending and receiving money globally. It was originally designed as a day-to-day payment system, to speed up and reduce the costs of transactions, and provide a mediatory currency for exchanges and conversions with minimum commission. \n\n Software developer Ryan Fugger founded the original Ripple project in 2004. The core idea behind the protocol was a peer-to-peer trust network of financial relations that would replace banks. Based on the premise that money is simply a bank’s promise of value, he aimed to create a monetary system where the promise of an individual held just as much weight. His concept was launched in 2005 as RipplePay, a financial service allowing users to extend credit lines to friends and family and make secure payments in traditional and online currencies. \n\n In 2012, Jed McCaleb, an American programmer and entrepreneur, along with Chris Larsen, an angel investor and startup executive, approached Ryan with a digital currency idea. Jed had been working on a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network. After discussions, Ryan handed over the reins to Jed and Chris, who co-founded the corporation OpenCoin, to develop the Ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. The company later changed its name to Ripple Labs. \n\n The Ripple platform is similar to Ethereum in that it has its a native currency (XRP) but is also open-source, allowing users to build their own assets and products on top of the existing platform. Ripple uses its proprietary patented technology, the ‘Ripple protocol consensus algorithm’ (RPCA), to verify transactions. It is argued that XRP is not technically a cryptocurrency because it is controlled by one company and transactions are processed by its network of approved validators. \n\n Ripple released its XRP token in January 2013. Like traditional cryptocurrencies, it is based on a public chain of cryptographic signatures. The company initially set the supply of XRP at 100 billion of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense. \n\n XRP enhances Ripple’s software by acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currencies, providing liquidity and speeding up cross-border transactions; however, it is not essential to the network and doesn’t have to be used. \n\n RippleNet is what Ripple calls the network of financial institutions using its products. There are three core segments: xCurrent for processing payments, xRapid to source liquidity, and xVia to connect to the network and send payments.",
